## Game planning
Create an array of three options, rock, scissors, and paper.

Create a drop down where Player A can choose either rock, paper, or scissors. 

Randomly choose one of the following options from the array and assign it as Player B's move

If Player A's move matches Player B's move then assign a tie
If Player A's move matches "rock" and Player B's move matches "scissors" then assign value winner to Player A
If Player A's move matches "paper" and Player B's move matches "rock" then assign value winner to Player A
If Player A's move matches "scissors" and Player B's move matches "paper" then assign value winner to Player A
All else, assign winner to Player B

Report the results of Player A's Move, Player B's move, and announce the winner to the page
