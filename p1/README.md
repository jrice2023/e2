If Player A's move matches "rock" and Player B's move matches "rock" then assign a tie
If Player A's move matches "rock" and Player B's move matches "scissors" then assign value winner to Player A
If Player A's move matches "rock" and Player B's move matches "paper" then assign value winner to Player B

If Player A's move matches "scissors" and Player B's move matches "scissors" then assign a tie
If Player A's move matches "scissors" and Player B's move matches "paper" then assign value winner to Player A
If Player A's move matches "scissors" and Player B's move matches "rock" then assign value winner to Player B

If Player A's move matches "paper" and Player B's move matches "paper" then assign a tie
